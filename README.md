# :us: VDPs in the US Government's executive branch 

[Binding Operational Directive 20-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01) requires most federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) [agencies](https://cyber.dhs.gov/agencies/) to have vulnerability disclosure policies (VDP). This repository gives the location of these agencies' VDPs; _it does not necessarily mean a given VDP is in alignment with BOD 20-01_. Review an agency's policy for information about current scope and submission location.

Though the Department of Defense is not subject to BOD 20-01, DoD does have a VDP at https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense.

(Note that the URL under `VDP link` is the one required by BOD 20-01 and may redirect.)
